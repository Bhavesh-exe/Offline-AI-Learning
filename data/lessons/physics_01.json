When an object changes its position relative to a reference point, we say the object is in motion.\n\nFor example:\n• A car moving on a road\n• A bird flying in the sky\n• Earth revolving around the Sun\n\nMotion is always relative. A person sitting in a moving bus is at rest relative to the bus but in motion relative to the ground."
